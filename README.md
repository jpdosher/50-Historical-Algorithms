# 50_Historical_Algorithms
An algorithm is sequence of rigorous instructions that are typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation and data processing. More advanced algorithms can use conditionals to divert the code execution through various routes and deduce valid inferences, achieving automation eventually.
